### What is AppyForm?

AppyForm is a service for **app developers** to add a feedback form to their apps. 


### Why use AppyForm? 

A great app needs to collect feedback properly, but building a form is a lot of work:

- Setting up the hosting infrastructure, and 
- Developing and maintaining a backend service, and
- Making sure your form looks perfect in different devices.

We built AppyForm to save you from all these work!


### Why choose AppyForm?

There are many reasons we may be your best option. Let us highlight one reason for you: With AppyForm, **you don't 
need to integrate any third-party library**. A few benefits follow,

- There is no need to maintain a library. For example, when the OS version changes, or a bug is found in the library.
- There will be bugs caused by third-party libraries clashes.
- Complete control on how the form shows up.

On top of that, our services are free (and very affordable if you choose our premium plans), our forms are highly 
customizable, and we are passionate about our work - we use AppyForm in our own apps!
