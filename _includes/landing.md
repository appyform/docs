## What is AppyForm?

AppyForm is a service for **app developers** to add a feedback form to their apps, no matter it's iOS, Android, Windows or other platforms. 


## Why show a feedback form? 

**Every app needs to collect feedback** in order to engage its users and to improve continously. Have you been receiving regular feedback from your users? Your competitors have.

Building a feedback form is a lot of work:

- Setting up the hosting infrastructure, and 
- Developing and maintaining a backend service, and
- Making sure your form looks perfect in different devices.

We built AppyForm to save you from all these work!


## Why choose AppyForm?

There are many reasons why we may be your best option. Let us highlight one for you: With AppyForm, **you don't 
need to integrate a third-party library from us**. A few benefits follow,

- There is no need to update the library. For example, when the OS version changes, or when a bug is found in the library.
- Third-party libraries don't know each other and can clash when used together. With AppyForm there is no library and this risk is minimized.  
- You have complete control on how the feedback form shows up.

On top of that, our services are free (and very affordable if you choose our premium plans), our forms are highly 
customizable, and we are passionate about our work - we use our forms in our own apps!
