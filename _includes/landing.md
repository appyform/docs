## What is AppyForm?

AppyForm is a service for **app developers** to add a feedback form to their apps. It can also be used by **website owners** to put feedback/registration form in their websites. 

Why was AppyForm built? Because we realized that collecting feedback is really important, but building a feedback form is a lot of work:

- Setting up the hosting infrastructure, and 
- Developing and maintaining a backend service, and
- Making sure your form looks nice in different devices.

We thought we could build a service to save you from all that, and we did!

## "Cool, how do I use it?"

Integrating AppyForm is really easy! You can use it no matter which camp you are in:

- iOS: [follow me]()
- Android: [this way please]()
- Neither? [come here]()
