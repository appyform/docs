### What is AppyForm?

AppyForm is a service for **app developers** to add a feedback form to their apps. It can also be used by **website owners** to put feedback/registration form in their websites. 

### Why use AppyForm? 

Because collecting feedback is so important, but building a feedback form requires lot of work:

- Setting up the hosting infrastructure, and 
- Developing and maintaining a backend service, and
- Making sure your form looks perfect in different devices.

We thought we could build a service to save you from all that, and we did!

### "Cool, how do I use it?"
