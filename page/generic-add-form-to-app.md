title: Add AppyForm in Other Platforms
---

No matter which app development platform your app is on, whether it is Adobe AIR, Titanium Appcelerator, Firefox OS, Unity, Windows or others - **AppyForm is available for you**!

Unlike some other service providers, our service does not require adding a third-party SDK into your app, which could cause integration and maintanence issues.

Our form is simply a website, so you can display it like how you would display any other websites. Each form hosted by us has a web address like the following:

    http://www.appyform.com/form/FORM-ACCESS-KEY

Therefore you can find your instructions by searching _"How to display webpage in [your app platform] development"_ in the Internet.

We are sorry about not able to providing detail instructions and code examples for every platform here. If you can share your examples, please let us know!
