title: Add AppyForm to your iOS app
---

Unlike some other service providers, our service does not require adding a third-party SDK into your app. 

How is this possible? Our form is simply a website, so you can use standard UI components to display it. 


### Sample projects

Choose from our sample projects below. Each of them has a FeedbackViewController that uses a UIWebView to display the feedback form. 

- Display form as a new stack in an existing UINavigationController hierarchy. ([project](https://github.com/appyform/ios-demo-nav) | [FeedbackViewController](https://github.com/appyform/ios-demo-nav/blob/master/AppyFormDemo/FeedbackViewController.m))
- Display form as a tab item in a UITabBarController. ([project](https://github.com/appyform/ios-demo-tab) | [FeedbackViewController](https://github.com/appyform/ios-demo-tab/blob/master/AppyFormDemo/FeedbackViewController.m))
- Present form from any view controller using presentViewController method. ([project](https://github.com/appyform/ios-demo-custom) | [FeedbackViewController](https://github.com/appyform/ios-demo-custom/blob/master/AppyFormDemo/FeedbackViewController.m))

You can download FeedbackViewController.m and .h and drag them to your project. Just remember to **update the access key** in the URL to that of your own. The access key of your form can be found in the dashboard after you sign in to AppyForm.

If you have any problems showing our forms, please let us help you!
